    <h1>Further Insights into Constitutional Development in India</h1>

    <div class="quote">
      “The evolution of India’s Constitution is not a chapter — it is an epic.” — Bibliotech
    </div>

    <h2>1. Evolution from Company Rule to Crown Rule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Regulating Act (1773) was a response to the financial crisis & corruption in East India Company.</li>
      <li>Pitt’s India Act (1784) clarified the duality of power — Company was administrator but Parliament had control.</li>
      <li>1858 marked the direct intervention of the Crown — beginning of Viceroy-led administration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Rise of Legislative Consciousness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Indian Councils Act of 1861 marked the start of Indian representation in legislation.</li>
      <li>By 1892 and 1909, nationalist pressure led to limited electoral provisions and expanded Indian membership.</li>
      <li>Though superficial, these reforms sowed seeds of political awakening.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. British Strategy Behind Reforms</h2>
    <div class="insight">
      The colonial strategy was clear — “Divide and Rule.”  
      <ul>
        <li>Separate electorates (1909) institutionalized communal divisions.</li>
        <li>Dyarchy (1919) was a confusing system — power without real authority.</li>
        <li>The 1935 Act gave autonomy but retained ultimate control with the Governor-General.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>4. Role of Indian Leaders in Shaping Constitutional Demands</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dadabhai Naoroji:</strong> Demanded self-governance, exposed economic drain.</li>
      <li><strong>Bal Gangadhar Tilak:</strong> “Swaraj is my birthright” became a constitutional demand.</li>
      <li><strong>Nehru Report (1928):</strong> First Indian effort to draft a constitution.</li>
      <li><strong>Gandhi:</strong> Mass movements pushed British into negotiating terms of constitutional reform (Round Table Conferences).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cripps Mission & Cabinet Mission</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cripps Mission (1942):</strong> Offered Dominion Status after war — rejected due to weak terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Cabinet Mission (1946):</strong> Proposed united India with groupings of provinces — accepted initially but failed later.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Legacy of Colonial Constitution-Making</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Federal structure, civil services, rule of law — inherited from British system.</li>
      <li>Communal electorates led to partition, but also formed the basis of debate on secularism in post-Independence India.</li>
      <li>1935 Act served as backbone of the Indian Constitution (over 250 provisions borrowed).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="insight">
      <strong>Did You Know?</strong><br>
      Indian Constituent Assembly was not fully elected through adult suffrage. It was partly nominated and partly indirectly elected by provincial assemblies.
    </div>

    <h2>UPSC Application</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mains GS2:</strong> Evolution of governance structure, colonial constitutional legacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Essay:</strong> “From subjects to citizens: Constitutional journey of India.”</li>
