    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Judicial review is the power vested in the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, to review and invalidate legislative and executive actions that are inconsistent with the Constitution. It serves as a key mechanism to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens and maintain the rule of law.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures that laws and governmental actions conform to constitutional provisions.</li>
      <li>Acts as a check on the arbitrary exercise of power by the legislature and the executive.</li>
      <li>Empowers citizens to seek redress when their fundamental rights are breached.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Constitutional Provisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Article 32:</strong> Grants the right to constitutional remedies and enables citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Article 136:</strong> Provides the Supreme Court with the discretion to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment or order in any matter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Landmark Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala (1973):</strong> Established the Basic Structure doctrine, limiting Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution.</li>
      <li><strong>Minerva Mills Ltd. vs. Union of India (1980):</strong> Emphasized the need for balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Shayara Bano vs. Union of India (2017):</strong> Demonstrated the power of judicial review by striking down unconstitutional provisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Judicial Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Judicial review protects the constitutional framework by ensuring that even emergency measures and legislative actions are subject to the supremacy of the Constitution. It remains a cornerstone in upholding the democratic values and rights of the citizens.
    </p>

    <h2>UPSC Relevance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Frequently asked in UPSC GS papers under Polity and Governance.</li>
      <li>Essential for understanding the balance of powers and the basic structure doctrine.</li>
