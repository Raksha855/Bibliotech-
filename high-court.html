    <h1>High Courts of India</h1>

    <div class="quote">
      “The High Courts are the custodians of justice at the state level, bridging the gap between the common man and the apex judicial authority.” – Bibliotech
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The High Courts are the highest judicial bodies at the state or union territory level in India. They serve as the principal courts of appeal and are responsible for upholding the rule of law, protecting fundamental rights, and ensuring the proper administration of justice within their territorial jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h2>Composition & Jurisdiction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Constitutional Basis:</strong> Established under Article 214 of the Constitution.</li>
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Each state (or group of states) has at least one High Court. Some states have a single High Court, while others have multiple benches.</li>
      <li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Includes original, appellate, and revisional powers. High Courts can hear appeals from subordinate courts and have the power to issue writs under Article 226.</li>
      <li><strong>Appointment:</strong> Judges are appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor of the concerned state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Functions of the High Courts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Judicial Review:</strong> They review decisions made by lower courts and administrative actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Writ Jurisdiction:</strong> They have the power to issue writs (Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Certiorari, Prohibition, and Quo Warranto) for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal remedies.</li>
      <li><strong>Appellate Jurisdiction:</strong> High Courts serve as appellate courts where cases from the lower courts are reviewed.</li>
      <li><strong>Supervisory Jurisdiction:</strong> They supervise and control the functioning of subordinate judiciary and administrative bodies in their respective territories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Differences from the Supreme Court</h2>
    <p>
      While the Supreme Court is the apex court with jurisdiction over the entire country, High Courts primarily administer justice at the state level. They play a crucial role in ensuring that state laws and actions conform to the Constitution, often acting as a bridge between the people and the higher judicial authority.
    </p>

    <h2>UPSC Relevance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Frequently discussed in UPSC prelims and mains as part of the judicial system.</li>
      <li>Important for essays and case studies on federalism and judicial accountability.</li>
      <li>Key for understanding the distribution of judicial powers and the role of writ jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Landmark Cases & Notable Observations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>State of Kerala v. N.S. Chandrasekharan Nair:</strong> Demonstrates the supervisory power over subordinate courts.</li>
      <li><strong>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978):</strong> Highlighted the broad interpretation of Article 21, impacting the role of High Courts.</li>
      <li><strong>Shivraj v. Union of India:</strong> Case highlighting the checks placed on arbitrary administrative actions by High Courts.</li>
    </ul>
