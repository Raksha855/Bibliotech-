    <h1>Ordinance-Making Power in India</h1>

    <div class="quote">
      “Ordinances are the temporary laws when the legislature sleeps; they are meant to keep the machinery of governance running in extraordinary times.” – Bibliotech
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The ordinance-making power is a unique executive power granted to the President under <strong>Article 123</strong> of the Indian Constitution. It allows the President, on the advice of the Council of Ministers, to promulgate temporary laws when either House of Parliament is not in session.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedure & Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> The Council of Ministers recommends the issuance of an ordinance to the President.</li>
      <li><strong>Proclamation:</strong> The President promulgates the ordinance, making it an act of law.</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The ordinance remains in force until Parliament reconvenes and passes it as a law, or it expires after 6 weeks of reassembly.</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> It is subject to subsequent approval by both Houses of Parliament.</li>
      <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Ordinances cannot be used to amend the Constitution, and they must be temporary in nature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flowchart of the Process</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Step</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1. Need Arises</td>
        <td>The government requires immediate action when Parliament is not in session.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2. Ministerial Advice</td>
        <td>The Council of Ministers advises the President to issue an ordinance.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3. Promulgation</td>
        <td>The President issues the ordinance, which becomes law immediately.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. Parliamentary Action</td>
        <td>Within 6 weeks of Parliament reconvening, the ordinance must be approved or it lapses.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Significance & UPSC Relevance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures continuous governance in emergencies or when Parliament is adjourned.</li>
      <li>Provides a check on the flexibility and power of the executive.</li>
      <li>Frequently discussed in UPSC GS II and Polity, especially regarding checks and balances in a democracy.</li>
      <li>Case studies and debates around ordinance usage (e.g., controversies during legislative adjournments) are pertinent for essays and ethics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Judicial Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      The judiciary has often scrutinized the excessive and prolonged use of ordinances to ensure they do not become a substitute for proper legislative procedure. The principle is that ordinances are temporary and must not undermine the Parliament's law-making authority.
