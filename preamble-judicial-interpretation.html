    <h1>Judicial Interpretation of the Preamble</h1>

    <p>The Preamble has been extensively interpreted by the Supreme Court in several landmark cases. Let’s explore how the judiciary has defined its role and importance.</p>

    <h2>1. <u>Berubari Union Case (1960)</u></h2>
    <p>
      - Supreme Court held that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution.  
      - It cannot be enforced in a court of law.  
      - It is useful for interpreting ambiguous provisions of the Constitution.
    </p>

    <h2>2. <u>Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973)</u></h2>
    <p>
      - A landmark judgment that overturned the Berubari view.  
      - Supreme Court ruled: <strong>Preamble is a part of the Constitution</strong>.  
      - It reflects the basic structure and cannot be amended in violation of the basic features.
    </p>

    <h2>3. <u>LIC of India Case (1995)</u></h2>
    <p>
      - Reaffirmed that Preamble is part of the Constitution.  
      - It expresses the philosophy and aims of the Constitution.  
      - Not directly enforceable, but still important in constitutional interpretation.
    </p>

    <h2>4. <u>Union of India vs. Madangopal (1954)</u></h2>
    <p>
      - Court held that the Preamble is key in understanding the spirit of the Constitution.  
      - It helps in resolving doubts in the construction of constitutional provisions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. <u>SR Bommai vs Union of India (1994)</u></h2>
    <p>
      - Court used the Preamble to declare <strong>Secularism as a basic feature</strong> of the Constitution.  
      - Governments can’t promote any particular religion in India.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Preamble is not just symbolic — it is an important tool for constitutional interpretation. It defines the spirit, values, and the guiding light of Indian democracy.
