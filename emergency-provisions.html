    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Constitution of India provides for three types of emergencies to address different kinds of crises:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>National Emergency (Article 352):</strong> Issued when the security or sovereignty of India is threatened.</li>
      <li><strong>State Emergency (President’s Rule, Article 356):</strong> Imposed when a state government fails to comply with constitutional requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Emergency (Article 360):</strong> Declared when the financial stability or credit of India is threatened.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>National Emergency – Article 352</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be proclaimed by the President if there is a threat to the security, external aggression, or armed rebellion.</li>
      <li>Once declared, the central government gains wide powers over the state governments.</li>
      <li>The proclamation must be laid before Parliament and is subject to judicial review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>State Emergency (President’s Rule) – Article 356</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Imposed when a state government is unable to function according to constitutional provisions.</li>
      <li>Allows the central government to assume the state’s executive functions temporarily.</li>
      <li>Must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within a specified period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Emergency – Article 360</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Declared by the President if the financial stability or credit of India is threatened.</li>
      <li>Once proclaimed, it gives the central government power to control financial resources and reduce state autonomy.</li>
      <li>Has a significant impact on the economy, including changes to the distribution of resources between the Union and the States.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Comparative Summary</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Type of Emergency</th>
        <th>Trigger</th>
        <th>Key Features</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>National Emergency (Art. 352)</td>
        <td>Threat to security, sovereignty, external aggression, or armed rebellion</td>
        <td>Centralization of power, suspension of fundamental rights (in certain circumstances)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>State Emergency (President’s Rule, Art. 356)</td>
        <td>Failure of state government to function according to the Constitution</td>
        <td>Central government takes over state functions temporarily</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Financial Emergency (Art. 360)</td>
        <td>Threat to the financial stability or credit of India</td>
        <td>Central control over financial resources, impact on state finances</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Judicial Oversight</h2>
    <p>
      The exercise of emergency powers is subject to judicial review. Landmark cases such as <strong>ADM Jabalpur vs Shivkant Shukla</strong> (1976) and subsequent cases have scrutinized the manner in which emergency powers affect individual rights and state autonomy.

      <li>Key to understanding the checks and balances in Indian democracy</li>
      <li>Used for essays and case studies regarding abuse of power and constitutional safeguards</li>
