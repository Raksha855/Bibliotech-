    <h1>National Income Accounting</h1>

    <div class="quote">"National Income tells us not just how much we earn as a country, but how wisely we grow together." — Bibliotech</div>

    <h2>What is National Income?</h2>
    <p>
      National Income is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of a country in a financial year. It reflects the economic health of a nation.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GDP (Gross Domestic Product):</strong> Total value of goods/services produced within the geographical boundary of a country.</li>
      <li><strong>GNP (Gross National Product):</strong> GDP + Income earned from abroad by residents - income earned by foreigners within the country.</li>
      <li><strong>NNP (Net National Product):</strong> GNP – Depreciation</li>
      <li><strong>National Income (at factor cost):</strong> NNP at factor cost (includes income earned by factors of production).</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Income:</strong> Total income actually received by individuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Disposable Income:</strong> Income remaining after direct taxes are deducted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Three Methods of Measuring National Income</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Formula</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Production Method</td>
        <td>Sum of value added by all producing units</td>
        <td>Gross Value Added = Output – Intermediate Consumption</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Income Method</td>
        <td>Sum of incomes earned by factors of production</td>
        <td>NI = Rent + Wages + Interest + Profits + Mixed Income</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Expenditure Method</td>
        <td>Sum of all expenditures made in an economy</td>
        <td>NI = C + I + G + (X - M)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Important Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Reduction in the value of capital goods over time due to wear and tear.</li>
      <li><strong>Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA):</strong> Income earned from abroad minus income paid to foreigners.</li>
      <li><strong>Subsidies:</strong> Government support to reduce the cost of production.</li>
      <li><strong>Indirect Taxes:</strong> Taxes like GST, Excise Duty etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UPSC Relevance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conceptual clarity is tested in both Prelims and Mains (GS Paper 3)</li>
      <li>Used in understanding economic surveys, budgets & current affairs</li>
      <li>Frequently appears in statements in objective questions (e.g., GDP vs GNP)</li>
    </ul>
